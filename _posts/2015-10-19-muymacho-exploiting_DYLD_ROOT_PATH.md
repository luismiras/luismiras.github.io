title: "muymacho - exploiting DYLD_ROOT_PATH"
---

[*muymacho*](https://github.com/luismiras/muymacho) is an exploit for a [dyld](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/dyld.1.html) bug present in Mac OS X 10.10.5 allowing local privilege escalation to root. It has been patched in El Capitan (10.11).

It was a fun bug and exploit to develop. This post is written as a guide through the process. You can follow along while viewing the dyld source. I hope you enjoy muymacho.  

This post covers the various stages of developing the exploit from discovery, past potential problems, to the completed exploit. 

> ... dyld_sim is a Mach-O file, but the exploit produces a dyld_sim that is just muymacho :)

# Discovery

The bug was discovered during a source code audit of [dyld-353.2.1](https://opensource.apple.com/source/dyld/dyld-353.2.1/) (10.10.0 to 10.10.4) and continued in IDA Pro with the binary release of the 10.10.5 update. Apple eventually released source for 10.10.5 on 9/17/2015. The post has been updated to include the newer dyld source code.

The interest in dyld came from a challenge [@iOn1c](https://twitter.com/i0n1c) posted on 7/20.

[![@i0n1c tweet](/assets/dyld_challenge.png){: .center-image }](https://twitter.com/i0n1c/status/623175447258484737)

I found the bug relating to the DYLD_PRINT_TO_FILE environment variable and wrote an exploit. Shortly afterwards, i0n1c released his [writeup](https://www.sektioneins.de/en/blog/15-07-07-dyld_print_to_file_lpe.html) and an exploit.

While I was hunting for the DYLD_PRINT_TO_FILE vulnerability, I spotted some questionable code. I went back and discovered a vulnerability related to DYLD_ROOT_PATH. I'm certainly not the first or only person to discover this vulnerability.

Note: I think that this vulnerability may have assigned CVE-2015-5876 (credited to [beist](https://twitter.com/beist) of grayhash). See the [CVE number](#cve-number) section in the appendix for more details. 

The DYLD_ROOT_PATH vulnerability is the subject of this post and is detailed in the following sections. It has been patched in El Capitan.


dyld is the dynamic linker for Mac OS X and iOS. It works in conjunction with the system loader to prepare a process for execution. The basic steps are: 

* The system loader maps both the binary's pages and dyld into memory. 
* Control is then handed over to dyld, so it can load and link other libraries and their dependencies into the process address space.  
* The process loading is complete and execution begins at the executableâ€™s entry point in memory. 

During the execution of a suid binary, dyld is running with elevated privileges. The binary has not actually begun executing and thus cannot yet lower privileges. 

For more details checkout these references [here](https://mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2012-11-09-dyld-dynamic-linking-on-os-x.html) and [here](http://www.newosxbook.com/articles/DYLD.html) (dyld is much more complex than summarized in this post).

The vulnerability is related to the use of the DYLD_ROOT_PATH environment variable. The following is an excerpt from the [dyld](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/dyld.1.html) man page:

> **DYLD_ROOT_PATH**
>
> This  is  a colon separated list of directories.  The dynamic linker will prepend each of this directory paths to every image access until a file is found.

While the above statement is true, there is an additional use that appears to be undocumented. In order to understand the use, we need to digress into discussing the iOS simulator. Unlike Android which uses an emulator (executes ARM instructions), iOS uses a simulator that runs applications compiled for x86_64. One of the simulator steps replaces the built in dyld with a special iOS simulator version. The special version is creatively called *dyld_sim*.

In order to to use dyld_sim, the DYLD_ROOT_PATH environment variable is set to a base directory before executing a program.

    $ DYLD_ROOT_PATH=/Users/user/tmp crontab

The example above expects dyld_sim to be located off of the base directory at the following location:

    /Users/user/tmp/usr/lib/dyld_sim


The details of the vulnerability are in the next section. However, spoiler alert, insufficient validation of the dyld_sim file is to blame. dyld_sim is a Mach-O file, but the exploit produces a dyld_sim that is just muymacho :)


# Vulnerability

The majority of this analysis references [dyld.cpp](https://opensource.apple.com/source/dyld/dyld-353.2.3/src/dyld.cpp) from dyld-353.2.3 (10.10.5), with the exception of the [10.10.4 section](#and-prior) in the appendix. The bug appears to have been introduced in [dyld-239.3](http://opensource.apple.com/source/dyld/dyld-239.3/) which coincides with the release of OS X 10.9.

The vulnerability is located in the **dyld.cpp:useSimulatorDyld()** function. If a dyld_sim file exists in the directory specified in the DYLD_ROOT_PATH variable, it's opened and the resulting file descriptor is passed to **useSimulatorDyld()**.

The code below shows the call from dyld.cpp:_main().

{% highlight c %}
   strlcat(simDyldPath, "/usr/lib/dyld_sim", PATH_MAX);
   int fd = my_open(simDyldPath, O_RDONLY, 0);
   if ( fd != -1 ) {
      result = useSimulatorDyld(fd, mainExecutableMH, simDyldPath, argc, argv, envp, apple, startGlue);
      if ( !result && (*startGlue == 0) )
         halt("problem loading iOS simulator dyld");
{% endhighlight %}


The function **useSimulatorDyld()** is shown below in its entirety. It handles the parsing and loading of dyld_sim. It should be noted that any failures in **useSimulatorDyld()** cause the process to halt.

The purpose of **useSimulatorDyld()** is to load dyld_sim, perform some validation, and then hand control over to it. dyld_sim begins execution and the original dyld will be no more.

As can be seen in the source above, **useSimulatorDyld()** does the following: 

1. Reads in Mach-O headers
2. Loops through LC_SEGMENT_64 commands and determines total size
3. vm_allocate() memory
4. mmap() segments into memory
5. Verifies the code signature
6. Jumps into the dyld_sim entry point

*muymacho* exploits a DYLD_ROOT_PATH vulnerability present since 10.9. However, there was an additional attack vector present in [versions up to 10.10.4](#and-prior), that has been patched in the 10.10.5 update.

The astute reader will notice that the vulnerability is in the processing of dyld_simâ€™s Mach-O headers. A malformed Mach-O file allows memory segments to be replaced leading to arbitrary execution of code, which happens prior to signature verification.

In order to understand how the remapping is possible, we need a little review of Mach-O. Apple provides a full Mach-O reference [document](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MachORuntime/index.html). However, the two relevant structures are shown below, with the most important one being segment_command_64.

{% highlight c %}
/*
 * The 64-bit mach header appears at the very beginning of object files for
 * 64-bit architectures.
 */
struct mach_header_64 {
   uint32_t      magic;      /* mach magic number identifier */
   cpu_type_t    cputype;    /* cpu specifier */
   cpu_subtype_t cpusubtype; /* machine specifier */
   uint32_t      filetype;   /* type of file */
   uint32_t      ncmds;      /* number of load commands */
   uint32_t      sizeofcmds; /* the size of all the load commands */
   uint32_t      flags;      /* flags */
   uint32_t      reserved;   /* reserved */
};

/*

 * command and their size is reflected in cmdsize.
 */
struct segment_command_64 { /* for 64-bit architectures */
   uint32_t   cmd;          /* LC_SEGMENT_64 */
   uint32_t   cmdsize;      /* includes sizeof section_64 structs */
   char       segname[16];  /* segment name */

   uint64_t   fileoff;      /* file offset of this segment */
   uint64_t   filesize;     /* amount to map from the file */
   vm_prot_t  maxprot;      /* maximum VM protection */
   vm_prot_t  initprot;     /* initial VM protection */
   uint32_t   nsects;       /* number of sections in segment */
   uint32_t   flags;        /* flags */
};
{% endhighlight %}

First **useSimulatorDyld()** needs to extract the Mach-O header. As can be seen in the source, there is some initial code to determine where the actual header is located in the case of a [universal binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_binary). dyld then reads in a page (0x1000 bytes) of data containing the Mach-O header.

After retrieving the header, **useSimulatorDyld()** processes the load commands. This is accomplished in two loops that cycle through load commands such as LC_SEGMENT_64, LC_UNIXTHREAD, and LC_CODE_SIGNATURE. 

The first of the two processing loops is shown below. It looks at LC_SEGMENT_64 load commands. It calculates the total *vmsize* and determines *preferredLoadAddress*. If no segments have a *fileoff* of 0, *preferredLoadAddress* defaults to 0.

{% highlight c %}

   for (uint32_t i = 0; i < cmd_count; ++i) {
      switch (cmd->cmd) {
         case LC_SEGMENT_COMMAND: // <-- Note: defined in a macro as LC_SEGMENT_64 
            {
               struct macho_segment_command* seg = (struct macho_segment_command*)cmd;
               mappingSize += seg->vmsize;
               if ( seg->fileoff == 0 )
                  preferredLoadAddress = seg->vmaddr;
            }
            break;
      }
      cmd = (const struct load_command*)(((char*)cmd)+cmd->cmdsize);
   }
{% endhighlight %}


**vm_allocate()** is called with the calculated *mappingSize*. The address of the allocated memory is stored in *loadAddress*. If the allocation fails, the **useSimulatorDyld()** function exits.

{% highlight c %}
   if ( ::vm_allocate(mach_task_self(), &loadAddress, mappingSize, VM_FLAGS_ANYWHERE) != 0 )
      return 0;
{% endhighlight %}

After allocating memory, the second loop is encountered and the relevant code can be seen below. This loop also parses LC_UNIXTHREAD and LC_CODESIGNATURE load commands, but they are not relevant to the vulnerability. 

The load command that leads to exploitation is LC_SEGMENT_64.

{% highlight c %}
case LC_SEGMENT_COMMAND: // <- this is defined in a macro as LC_SEGMENT_64
   {
      struct macho_segment_command* seg = (struct macho_segment_command*)cmd;
      uintptr_t requestedLoadAddress = seg->vmaddr - preferredLoadAddress + loadAddress;
      void* segAddress = ::mmap((void*)requestedLoadAddress, seg->filesize, seg->initprot, MAP_FIXED | MAP_PRIVATE, fd, fileOffset + seg->fileoff);
      //dyld::log("dyld_sim %s mapped at %p\n", seg->segname, segAddress);
      if ( segAddress == (void*)(-1) )
         return 0;
   }
{% endhighlight %}

Looking at the code, the intended function of the case statement is to map segments into the newly allocated memory. However, there is **almost zero validation of the LC_SEGMENT_64 fields**. Specifically, the code calculates a *requestedLoadAddress* based on controllable fields in a Mach-O binary.

{% highlight c %}
uintptr_t requestedLoadAddress = seg->vmaddr - preferredLoadAddress + loadAddress;
{% endhighlight %}

*preferredLoadAddress* defaults to 0, leaving only *loadAddress* and *seg->vmaddr* in play. The following is a simplified equation that will be used throughout this post in various forms:

    requestedLoadAddress = seg->vmaddr + loadAddress

*seg->vmaddr* is taken directly from the segment command and added to *loadAddress* (set by vm_allocate). This results in a partially controlled *requestedLoadAddress* which is then passed to mmap. 

mmap is using some very interesting flags, in particular MAP_FIXED. The following is an excerpt from the [mmap](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man2/mmap.2.html) man page:

> **MAP_FIXED**
>
> Do not permit the system to select a different address than the one specified.  If
the specified address cannot be used, mmap() will fail.  If MAP_FIXED is specified,
addr must be a multiple of the pagesize.  If a MAP_FIXED request is successful, the
mapping established by mmap() **replaces any previous mappings** for the process' pages
in the range from addr to addr + len.  Use of this option is discouraged.

The key words are *"replaces any previous mapping"*. Mappings such as heaps, the stack, and even executable pages can be replaced. An attacker can create a Mach-O file with crafted LC_SEGMENT_64 load commands. This provides not only partial control of *requestedLoadAddress*, but also full control of page permissions, *filesize*, and *fileoff*.

Manual testing within the debugger confirmed successful replacement of executable pages upon the return of the mmap system call.

# Exploit

The following is a cheat sheet, providing a quick reference to various definitions and terms:

Given the ability to replace executable pages in memory, exploitation becomes relatively simple. ROP is not necessary since we control the content of the newly mapped executable pages. Our target page for remapping will be the page containing the mmap system call in dyld. If modern OS X did not have [ASLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization), this would be trivial. We first cover exploitation without ASLR, then cover how to [bypass](#bypassing-aslr) it 

Since dyld is the dynamic linker, it needs to be self contained. dyld includes all the system calls it uses. The **useSimulatorDyld()** function calls the **::mmap()** function (wrapper) which in turn calls **___mmap()**.

    00007FFF5FC2693E           mov     r12d, ecx
    00007FFF5FC26941           mov     r8d, r15d
    00007FFF5FC26944           call    ___mmap
    00007FFF5FC26949           mov     rbx, rax
    00007FFF5FC2694C           lea     rax, ___syscall_logger

The **___mmap()** function contains the mmap system call.

    00007FFF5FC26DBC ___mmap   proc near               ; CODE XREF: _mmap+31p
    00007FFF5FC26DBC           mov     eax, 20000C5h
    00007FFF5FC26DC1           mov     r10, rcx
    00007FFF5FC26DC4           syscall
    00007FFF5FC26DC6           jnb     short locret_7FFF5FC26DD0



When the mmap system call returns, the instruction pointer will be at address 0x7fff5fc26dc6. Passing mmap a *requestedLoadAddress* of 0x7fff5fc26000 will replace our targeted mmap system call page. With the segment mapped in, the process begins executing our code.


As shown previously, the requestedLoadAddress is calculated in the second loop like so:

{% highlight c %}
 uintptr_t requestedLoadAddress = seg->vmaddr - preferredLoadAddress + loadAddress;
{% endhighlight %}

The simplified mmap_equation (preferredLoadAddress defaults to 0) is:

    requestedLoadAddress = seg->vmaddr + loadAddress

If we recall, *loadAddress* is set by the call to vm_allocate.  As shown below, vm_allocate returns an address located after the base programâ€™s pages. For example, crontab generates the following memory map:

    ==== regions for process 44045  (non-writable and writable regions are interleaved)

Given the memory map above, *loadAddress* is 0x100009000 (VM_ALLOCATE). Solving for *seg->vmaddr* results in 0x7ffe5fc1d000, which would replace the dyld executable page at 0x7fff5fc26000.

    seg->vmaddr = requestedLoadAddress - loadAddress
    seg->vmaddr = 0x7fff5fc26000 - 0x100009000
    seg->vmaddr = 0x7ffe5fc1d000

We can craft Mach-O file with a *seg->vmaddr* value of 0x7ffe5fc1d000 and the exploit would be done.

The above memory map and calculations do not include ASLR in order to simplify discussion. The next section delves into bypassing ASLR.


# Bypassing ASLR

The following is an updated cheat sheet. providing a quick reference to various definitions and terms:

> **CHEAT SHEET**
>
> **loadAddress** 
: address returned by vm_allocate()
>
> **vmaddr** 
: segment's vmaddr value (seg->vmaddr)
>
> **dyld_target** 
: dyld page we are targetting (contains the mmap syscall)
>
> **mmap_equation** 
: requestedLoadAddress = vmaddr + loadAddress
>
> **ASLR slide** 
: random offset applied to memory regions
: 0x0000000 to 0xffff000 bytes (0 to 0xffff pages)
> 

The previous section ignores [ASLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization), which must be considered. ASLR adds slides to various memory regions including executable pages, stack, and the dyld executable pages. This is done to mitigate attacks since there aren't set memory addresses for resources. 

The following is an example of a memory layout with ASLR. Notice how dyld isnâ€™t loaded at its preferred offset unlike the previous vmmap output, and is in fact slid by 0x9f40000 bytes.

Other memory regions contain slides. The base binary, crontab, has a 0xda7000 byte slide. The same slide also applies to *loadAddress* (VM_ALLOCATE region). 

## Memory regions and ranges

The [exploit](#exploit) section solves for the *vmaddr* value which when added to *loadAddress* replaces the *dyld_target* (0x7fff5fc26000) executable page. Our goal is unchanged, we want to map over the *dyld_target* page with our content. However, we are no longer working with set addresses. We are working with ranges of possible addresses.

Before formulating a plan of attack, we need to determine what the actual memory ranges are. Taking ASLR into account, the possible ranges become:

* **loadAddress**: 0x100009000 to 0x110008000 (max ASLR slide = 0x0ffff000)
* **dyld_target**: 0x7fff5fc26000 - 0x7fff6fc25000 (max ASLR slide = 0x0ffff000)

Next, we calculate *vmaddr*'s possible range of values. We want mmap to replace the *dyld_target* page, so *dyld_target* is substituted for *requestedLoadAddress* in the mmap_equation:

    vmaddr = dyld_target - loadAddress

In order to determine the *vmaddr* range, we solve for both the minimum *vmaddr* as well as the maximum *vmaddr*. The following diagram should help illustrate how the range is calculated:

![ASLR range](/assets/aslr_ranges.png){: .center-image }

The left hand side of the diagram shows the minimum possible *vmaddr*. It is uses the lowest possible *dyld_target* and the highest possible *loadAddress*.

{% highlight python %}
vmaddr_min = (dyld_target + ASLR_slide_min) - (loadAddress + ASLR_slide_max)
vmaddr_min = (0x7fff5fc26000 + 0x00000000) - (0x100009000 + 0x0ffff000)
vmaddr_min = 0x7fff5fc26000 - 0x110008000
vmaddr_min = 0x7ffe4fc1e000
{% endhighlight %}

The right hand side of the diagram shows the maximum possible *vmaddr*. It is uses the highest possible *dyld_target* and the lowest possible *loadAddress*.

{% highlight python %}
vmaddr_max = (dyld_target + ASLR_slide_max) - (loadAddress + ASLR_slide_min)
vmaddr_max = (0x7fff5fc26000 + 0x0ffff000) - (0x100009000 + 0x00000000)
vmaddr_max = 0x7fff6fc25000 - 0x100009000
vmaddr_max = 0x7ffe6fc1c000
{% endhighlight %}

The *vmaddr* range is between 0x7ffe4fc1e000 and 0x7ffe6fc1c000. The entire range covers 0x1fffe000 bytes (twice the maximum ASLR slide). 

In order to reliably exploit the vulnerabilty, the complete range of memory may need to be mapped in. It's impractical to map to the entire range in a single segment (nobody wants a 500+ MB exploit !), so we'll use multiple segments.



## Potential problems

At this point, we have to answer a few more questions :

* How many segments should be used?
* Can mmap fail?
* Can unwanted memory corruption occur?

### How many segments should be used?
The Mach-O header is read in as only one page (0x1000 bytes) Given that the *mach_header_64* structure is 0x20 bytes and the *segment_command_64* structure is 72 bytes, there can be a maximum of 56 segments. In order to simplify calculations, *muymacho* uses 32 segments. All the segment's *fileoff* fields will point to the same data (0x1000000 bytes).

![segments](/assets/macho.png){: .center-image }

The 32 segments will cover the entire *vmaddr* range (0x1fffe000) with a page to spare.

![segment_range](/assets/segment_range.png){: .center-image }


**TLDR: 32 segments** 

### Can mmap fail?

The portion of **useSimulatorDyld()**'s code that calls mmap is show again below. Note that the **useSimulatorDyld()** function exits if the mmap call fails.

{% highlight c %}
   void* segAddress = ::mmap((void*)requestedLoadAddress, seg->filesize, seg->initprot, MAP_FIXED | MAP_PRIVATE, fd, fileOffset + seg->fileoff);
   //dyld::log("dyld_sim %s mapped at %p\n", seg->segname, segAddress);
   if ( segAddress == (void*)(-1) )
      return 0;
{% endhighlight %}

mmap will fail if it attempts to map memory outside of user space (greater than 0x7fffffffffff). We need to ensure that the following is true:

{% highlight python %}
requestedLoadAddress + seg->filesize < 0x7fffffffffff
{% endhighlight %}

Due to ASLR, we don't know the actual *loadAddress* and *dyld_target* addresses. We calculated the minimum (0x7ffe4fc1e000) and maximum (0x7ffe6fc1c000) *vmaddr* which define the range of offsets we must cover in order to negate ASLR. 

To calculate the maximum possible *requestedLoadAddress*, we use the mmap_equation and plug in the maximum possible *vmaddr* and the maximum possible *loadAddress*.

{% highlight python %}
requestedLoadAddress = vmaddr + loadAddress
requestedLoadAddress = 0x7ffe6fc1c000 + (loadAddress + 0x0ffff000)
requestedLoadAddress = 0x7ffe6fc1c000 + (0x100009000 + 0x0ffff000)
requestedLoadAddress = 0x7ffe6fc1c000 + 0x110008000 
requestedLoadAddress = 0x7fff7fc24000
{% endhighlight %}

A *requestedLoadAddress* of 0x7fff7fc24000 is well within user space bounds. *seg->filesize* would need to be greater than 0x803dbfff for the mmap call to fail.

**TLDR: mmap is fine :)**

### Can unwanted memory corruption occur?

Mapping in such large segments (0x1000000), may cause some concern. It really comes down to:

1. Are we going to corrupt the stack while trying to replace *dyld_target*?

2. What happens if we map over a portion of dyld's pages?

The implementation section will show that muymacho uses a top down strategy. This approach ensures higher pages get replaced first followed by lower pages. The stack is lower than the *dyld_target* page in memory and at a safe distance. The stack is fine :) 

It is possible that only some of dyld pages get mapped in by a segment. The rest of pages would then be mapped in by the next segment. Does it matter? No.

The mmap system call, the wrapper function, and the majority of the parsing loop from **useSimulatorDyld()** is all contained in the *dyld_target* page. The rest of **useSimulatorDyld()** is at lower page.

**TLDR: everything is fine :)**

## Implementation

*muymacho* uses 32 segments to cover an address range of 0x20000000 bytes. This ensures that entire ASLR memory range is covered. Segments will be mapped in until the *dyld_target* page is replaced, at which point our code takes control.

A top down strategy is used to prevent unncessary memory corruption, in particular of the stack. The first segment uses the maximum *vmaddr* value. Subsequent segments use smaller values, allowing the entire range to be covered. The following graphic provides an example. Keep in mind that it is not to scale. *dyld_target* is one page while the segments are 4096 pages each.


![memory map](/assets/top_down.png){: .center-image }

Eventually *dyld_target* will be mapped and code execution is achieved. Once the *dyld_target* page is replaced, control will be instant upon the return of the mmap call.

### Maximum vmaddr

The maximum *vmaddr*  used in *muymacho* differs from what we previously calculated. The following function calculates the maximum *vmaddr*:

{% highlight python %}
def maximum_vmaddr(segment_size):
    '''
    returns the maximum vmaddr
    
    the function assumes the base binary is 9 pages long
    as is the case for crontab giving a 
    loadAddress_min of 0x100009000
    
    if attacking other suid programs, this value should
    be adjusted. in reality a few pages here or there
    won't have a noticeable effect.
    '''
    dyld_target = 0x7fff5fc26000
    loadAddress_min = 0x100009000 
    aslr_slide_max = 0x0ffff000

    dyld_target_max = dyld_target + aslr_slide_max
    maximum_offset = dyld_target_max - loadAddress_min

    # Only one page from the payload needs to hit the maximum offset.
    vmaddr = maximum_offset - segment_size + 0x1000  

    return vmaddr
{% endhighlight %}

The only difference is the following portion of code:

{% highlight python %}
    # Only one page from the payload needs to hit the maximum offset.
    vmaddr = maximum_offset - segment_size + 0x1000  
{% endhighlight %}

The original maximum *vmaddr* calculations assume we are mapping in a single page. We are actually mapping in 4096 pages at a time. 

The calculation is adjusted to only map in one page at the maximum *vmaddr*, otherwise we are wasting pages that will never replace *dyld_target*.

The following graphic may help clarify the concept:

![vmaddr adjust](/assets/vmaddr_adjust.png){: .center-image }


The left hand side shows the original maximum *vmaddr* (0x7ffe6fc1c000) replacing the highest possible dyld_target. All the other pages are superflous, since we are already at the maximum possible *vmaddr* and the highest possible *dyld_target*. Only one page from this segment could hit a possible *dyld_target*.

The right hand side uses the adjusted *vmaddr* (7ffe6ec1d000). The segment will replace the highest possible *dyld_target*. All 4096 segment pages could replace possible *dyld_target* pages. 



# Payload

The [Bypassing ASLR](#bypassing-aslr) section ensures a segment will be mapped over *dyld_target*. The payload is 0x1000000 or 4096 pages in total. One of those pages will replace the *dyld_target* page.

The dyld mmap system call is shown again below.

    00007FFF5FC26DBC ___mmap   proc near               ; CODE XREF: _mmap+31p
    00007FFF5FC26DBC           mov     eax, 20000C5h
    00007FFF5FC26DC1           mov     r10, rcx
    00007FFF5FC26DC4           syscall
    00007FFF5FC26DC6           jnb     short locret_7FFF5FC26DD0

When the mmap system call returns, execution will continue at offset 0xdc6 in the page. Since rax is used as a return value, it will contain the base address of the newly mapped memory. In other words, rax points to the start of our payload. 

All 4096 payload pages contain a *jmp rax* at offset 0xdc6. The first page at the base of the payload also contains the shellcode at offset 0. 

The following diagram shows the base page and a standard page.  

![payload pages](/assets/pages.png){: .center-image }


Regardless of which page lines up with *dyld_target*, the *jmp rax* instruction will be executed leading to the shellcode.  

The shellcode then performs a setuid(0) syscall call followed by execve('/bin/sh') system call.


# Finished exploit

This section combines everything we've figured out this far. In summary:

* Our goal is to remap *dyld_target*, which is the page contain the mmap system call within dyld
* We use 32 segments spanning 0x20000000 bytes to bypass ASLR
    * We implement a top down strategy
    * The first segment has a *vmaddr* of 0x7ffe6ec1d000
    * Subsequent segments have smaller (0x1000000) *vmaddr* 
* All the segments point to the same 4096 pages of payload
    * All pages contain a *jmp rax* instruction at offset 0xdc6
    * The base page contains our shellcode

*muymacho* is written in python and is available on [github](https://github.com/luismiras/muymacho). There is a very minimal Mach-O implementation in the *MachoFile* and *LC_SEGMENT_64* classes. They create a dyld_sim file containing 32 segments, all pointing to the payload. 

*muymacho* is passed a base directory and will create the necessary directory structure and dyld_sim file. The actual exploitation requires setting DYLD_ROOT_PATH to the base directory and executing a suid binary. A sample run is shown below.

# Patch
El Capitan made many changes to dyld. In particular, the validation on the dyld_sim file is much more strict, closing the vulnerability muymacho uses. There are various checks to ensure that consecutive segments have appropriate *fileoff* and *vmaddr* values.

At the time of this post, Apple has not yet released El Capitan source code. The changes can be examined in IDA Pro.


# Conclusion

This concludes the majority of the post (be sure to check out the [super sekret debug shellcode](#super-sekret-debug-shellcode)). We've discusses a vulnerability from discovery, through potential problems, to exploitation. The complete exploit is on [github](https://github.com/luismiras/muymacho).

I hope this post has been helpful. It was a fun bug and I very much enjoyed  writing *muymacho*.

Thanks to everyone ([Pete Markowsky](https://twitter.com/transzorp), [Ian Melven](https://twitter.com/imelven), [Josha Bronson](https://twitter.com/RaiseAllin)) that reviewed this post. Also thanks to [@iOn1c](https://twitter.com/i0n1c) for posting his challenge which led to finding this bug.

# super sekret debug shellcode 

Sometimes I am curious as to which segment was used in exploitation as well as the various ASLR addresses. In practice, the actual addresses are irrelevant. I included a debug shellcode that provides this information back to the user.

The super sekret debug shellcode is selected by passing a "-d" command line switch. After *muymacho* returns with the hashtag symbol (aka #), be sure to type in:

    echo "$MUYMACHO"

![debug infoz](/assets/debug_infoz.png){: .center-image }

Feel free to take a look a the debug shellcode in *muymacho*. Debug information is passed through the execve call in an environment variable.

# Appendix

## 10.10.4 and prior

Mac OS X 10.10.4 and prior have an additional DYLD_ROOT_PATH vector. This section discusses the older vector and 10.10.5 update. OS X 10.10.4 uses [dyld.cpp](http://opensource.apple.com/source/dyld/dyld-353.2.1/src/dyld.cpp) from [dyld-353.2.1](http://opensource.apple.com/source/dyld/dyld-353.2.1).

Early in useSimulatorDyld() code, there is a check to verify that dyld_sim is owned by root. 

{% highlight c %}
// verify simulator dyld file is owned by root
   struct stat sb;
   if ( fstat(fd, &sb) == -1 )
      return 0;
   if ( sb.st_uid != 0 )
      return 0;
{% endhighlight %}

While auditing the function, it becomes apparent that the code signing requirement is optional. Thus, the only requirement is a root owned non signed *dyld_sim* which isn't too high of a barrier. **useSimulatorDyld()** will gladly load it and execute it.

### 10.10.5 update

The [10.10.5 update](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205267) brought fixes for the DYLD_PRINT_FILE vulnerability (CVE-2015-3760 credited to: [beist](https://twitter.com/beist) of grayhash, [Stefan Esser](https://twitter.com/i0n1c)). It also included changes to **useSimulatorDyld()** function likely due to the discovery of the previous vector.

dyld_sim no longer needs to be owned by root, however code signing is now mandatory. The following code snippet is from [dyld.cpp](https://opensource.apple.com/source/dyld/dyld-353.2.3/src/dyld.cpp).

{% highlight c %}

   int result = fcntl(fd, F_ADDFILESIGS_FOR_DYLD_SIM, &siginfo);
   if ( result == -1 ) {
      dyld::log("fcntl(F_ADDFILESIGS_FOR_DYLD_SIM) failed with errno=%d\n", errno);
      return 0;
   }
{% endhighlight %}

A new fcntl command was added in 10.10.5 specifically for dyld_sim. The following excerpt is from /usr/include/sys/fcntl.h.

{% highlight c %}
#define F_ADDFILESIGS_FOR_DYLD_SIM 83   /* Add signature from same file, only if it is signed by Apple (used by dyld for simulator) */
{% endhighlight %}

dyld_sim needs to be signed by Apple; a developer certificate is not sufficient.

## CVE number

It is somewhat unclear what CVE number this bug has been assigned. The [El Capitan](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205267) security update lists the following bug credited to [beist](https://twitter.com/beist):

> Dev Tools
>
Available for: Mac OS X v10.6.8 and later
>
Impact: A malicious application may be able to execute arbitrary code with system privileges

The same CVE is also listed on the [iOS 9](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205212) and [watchOS 2](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205213) update. A cursory examination of dyld from iOS 8.4.1 did not reveal the same vulnerability muymacho exploits. I could be mistaken and will update this post if that is the case.
